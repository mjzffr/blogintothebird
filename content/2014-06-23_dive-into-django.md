Summary: For better or worse, how I approached my first contribution to a Django app without knowing anything about Django and what I learned.

Context: I downloaded project source from Github, I have built the project, populated local db and I want to contribute. Mozilla used Playdoh, not just Django
Read a lot, did tutorial.
Looked at database schema
Followed urls.py
Testing with mockmyid and persona
Class-based generic views
Resources that I found useful
