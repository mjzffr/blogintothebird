Throughout my OPW[^1] internship with Mozilla QA[^2] I've been keeping an informal log in outline form[^3]. In it, I briefly describe what I accomplish (or fail to accomplish) each day, problems I encounter, who I talk to about them, which meetings I attend, what I read, useful tricks I learn, etc. So far, I have about 60-days worth of these tiny log entries about Mozilla.  Here's what they look like:

Day-to-day, the log helps me answer questions like "How did I solve this weird configuration problem 3 weeks ago?" or "What should I ask about at the next team meeting?" Writing also generally helps me think through a task, and the log is a quick and effective outlet for that. The other major benefit is that I can take a step back and see the overall progress of my projects.

# So, what's it like being an intern with Mozilla QA?

I'm so glad you asked! Based on my handy log, I'll answer a slightly more specific question: _"What does Maja do during a typical week as an intern with Mozilla QA?"_

First, some context. 

* OPW interns [work remotely]({filename}./2014-05-23_remote-work.md).
* The internship position I applied for is called "[Bug Wrangler](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GNOME_Outreach_Summer2014#Mozilla_Bug_Wrangler_.28Desktop_QA.29)", which refers to tasks like reproducing and triaging incoming Firefox bugs, but I've actually (mostly) been doing Django web development.

To future interns: as in my case, there can be some flexibility about your internship activities, and during your application process, you'll narrow down what you will work on. The mentor I applied to offered a Django project as an option under the Bug Wrangler umbrella, and that was more in line with my interests and experience than bug triage, so that's what I chose to focus on.
