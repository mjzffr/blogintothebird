Summary: I got an internship with Mozilla (!). The application process alone taught me a lot about open source contributions and the community around them. 

I just started an intership with Mozilla as part of the GNOME Foundation's Outreach Program for Women, but I almost didn't even apply! In fact, I had decided *not* to apply for silly reasons, and then a week before the *extended* deadline I abruptly changed my mind -- after some encouragement from the wonderful people at my Hacker School batch.

I'm very pleased that I did apply in the end, not just because I was ultimately selected for an intership but because the process itself was incredibly instructive. By the time I submitted my applicatoin, I felt like I could make more FOSS contributions on my own even if I didn't get an intership. This is because overcoming initial barriers is built into the application process: I interacted with people on IRC and it was scary but productive and good; I posted to project mailing lists and it was scary but productive and good; I added information to bugs in Bugzilla, and it was scary but productive and good. You get the idea... At each step, I made silly mistakes, but I fixed them and nothing terrible happened and no one seemed to hate me.

But wait, what's this Outreach Program for Women? The GNOME Foundation and many others want more people who identify as women or genderqueer to be involved in contributions to free and open source software (FOSS). Awesome! So one thing GNOME does is organize payed internships with various FOSS organizations especially for this category of humans. To apply, the human in question must learn about the participating organizations and their available projects, choose one or more projects of interest, *interact with current contributors* and *contribute something themselves*. Depending on the project, one's application process might take a few weeks. 

I spent pretty much 7 *full* days on my application. I wanted to contribute something more substantial but I ran out of time. That being said, the application is actually quite flexible and varies across organizations. I could have continued my contributions after the application deadline -- the reason I didn't boils down to other time constraints on my side.

Other applicants: quite substantial, contributed after deadline, difficultly building the project

[I'm please I changed my mind and I want to encourage other people to apply because the application process alone is a great learning experience even if you don't get in.]
