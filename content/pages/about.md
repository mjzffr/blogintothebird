I care about free and open source software, an open web, education and things like that; I enjoy Python and its wonderful community; I'm "never graduating" from [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com); my professional life is centered around programming and computer science -- it's the coolest; I used to do a lot of math and I vaguely miss it, but we can't have time for everything; overall, I aim to spend as little time at a computer as possible (ha!) and I bake pretty delightful cookies. 

Recommended English pronunciation: *__ma__-ya free-dree-__ha__-vitch* 

The 'Z' stands for Zofia: *__zo__-fya*
