I care about free and open source software, an open web, education and things like that. I enjoy Python and its wonderful community. I'm "never graduating" from [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com). My professional life is centered around programming and computer science -- it's the coolest. I used to do a lot of formal math and I vaguely miss it, but we can't have time for everything. Overall, I aim to spend as little time at a computer as possible (ha!) and I bake pretty delightful cookies.
