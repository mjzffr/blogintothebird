My [professional life](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfrydrychowicz) is centered around programming and computer science -- it's the coolest. I care about free and open source software, an open web  computing education and that sort of thing. I enjoy Python and its wonderful community. I'm "never graduating" from Hacker School, which is now known as [The Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com). I used to do a lot of formal math and I vaguely miss it, but we can't have time for everything. Sometimes, I bake fairly excellent cookies. Other times, I go exploring and take [pretty pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/majusia/) of what I find.
