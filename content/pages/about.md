My professional life is centered around programming and computer science -- it's the coolest. I care about free and open source software, an open web,  computing education and that sort of thing. I'm lucky to be part of the [best programming community in the world](https://www.recurse.com). During my grad school years, I used to do lots of formal math and I vaguely miss it. Sometimes, mostly on airplanes and trains, I knit [decent socks](https://flic.kr/p/xbqJSu). Sometimes, I bake fairly excellent cookies. Not often enough, I go exploring and take [pretty pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/majusia/) of what I find.
